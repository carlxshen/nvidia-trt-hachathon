# Nvidia TRT Hackathon Project

## Intro

This is the repo of Nvidia TRT Hackathon. Our team is Directed Acyclic Graph, a.k.a, DAG.

As the hackathon is to optimize an interested model, the one we choose to use is [CenterPoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11275), which you can also find as a submodule in this repo.

Another external repo is the official model optimization skeleton.
